            <h2>About the Lab</h2>
            <p>
                The d.Phi Lab (Experimental Philosophy Lab) at UFMG is dedicated to investigating philosophical questions through empirical methods. We combine traditional philosophical inquiry with experimental approaches, using surveys, behavioral experiments, and statistical analysis to shed light on fundamental questions about mind, morality, knowledge, and meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our research bridges the gap between armchair philosophy and empirical science, bringing data-driven insights to age-old philosophical debates. We believe that understanding how people actually think, reason, and make judgments is essential for developing robust philosophical theories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in [YEAR], the lab brings together philosophers, psychologists, and cognitive scientists to explore questions at the intersection of philosophy and empirical research. Our work spans multiple areas including moral psychology, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cross-cultural philosophy.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to advance philosophical understanding through rigorous empirical investigation, foster collaboration between philosophy and the sciences, and train the next generation of experimental philosophers. Our work contributes to both theoretical debates in philosophy and practical applications in ethics, education, and public policy.
