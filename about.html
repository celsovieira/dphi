            <h2>About the Lab</h2>
            <p>
D-Phi is a laboratory for experimental philosophy at the University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil. It is coordinated by Celso Vieira and funded by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).            </p>
            <p>
Our research bridges the gap between theoretical philosophy and empirical science by bringing data-driven insights to philosophical investigations. We believe understanding how people and different populations think, reason, and make judgments is essential to developing robust models that improve our understanding of long-standing philosophical debates.            </p>
            <p>
The lab was conceived to promote the use of any data-based method in the practice of philosophy. We are committed to fostering projects that use surveys, behavioral experiments, statistical analysis, text mining, game theory, artificial intelligence, qualitative research, and any other innovative methods our members may propose.            </p>
