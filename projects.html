                <p>We recognize that empirical research requires alternating between <strong> slow and fast science</strong> approaches.</p>
                <p>Slow science refers to long-term investigations consisting of multiple studies that aim to shed light on complex issues by creating a solid body of work.</p>
                <p>Our initial<strong> slow science research project</strong> spans the interdisciplinary fields of applied ethics, moral psychology, and cognitive science. Broadly speaking, our goal is to explore useful models that capture the relationship between moral beliefs and actions. To accomplish this, we will test which, if any, of the various dual-model theories fit the behavior exhibited by people in our empirical investigation. Furthermore, given our applied and developmentalist approach, we aim to find models that can provide us with tools to become more consistent moral actors.</p>
                <p>In the first phase, we will focus on the concepts of beneficence, altruism, and charity. This area provides an ideal opportunity to examine the suboptimal relationship between our moral beliefs and actions. After all, most people believe beneficence is praiseworthy yet fail to act accordingly.</p>
                <p>In our context, <strong>fast science</strong> involves designing a relatively simple experiment with a small scope that can be quickly implemented. This allows philosophers to capture current phenomena that may offer unique opportunities to shed light on more general philosophical questions. 
<br>Ex. During a humanitarian crisis, philosophers may want to investigate changes in people’s judgments about positive duties and obligations to take action.</p>
                <p>Fast science at D-Phi is also important because it allows our younger researchers to apply empirical methods to their research interests. Accordingly, the subject of investigation is completely open. Each researcher can decide what to explore.</p>
